PIC32 RC Controller General Notes:

This project supports either the standard 8 data bit LCD interface 
using JB and JC or the 4 data bit 4x20 LCD interface using only JC.  
The project also provides for serial communications at 19200 BAUD. 
Any RC channel can be set by entering two number as "1 55". The first
value is the channel number (0 - 7) and the second the position 
(0 - 100).  A position setting of 50 is the neutral position.

Project specific notes:

The current version of this project only supports 4 servos 
but can be easily expanded by adding states to the "set_RC" function
and adding to the RC channel pin macros define in RC.h.

This project uses a single timer interrupt to generate all 8 channel
outputs. The Timer1 interrupt period is set for 10 microseconds. This 
provides for 1% position resolution. As written, the configuration 
sets the PIC32 core frequency for 40 MHz and the peripheral bus 
clock to 10 MHz. 

The CONU1 code provides for a non-blocking get string function.  The 
maximum string size for this function is 80 characters. A buffer must be 
passed to this function that has a length of up to the 80 character limit. 
The character string is terminated with either a LF or CR character. When
the terminating character is detected, the captured character string is 
copied to the array supplied to the function with a NULL termination in
place of the LF or CR character. Until the terminal LF or CR is detected, 
the function returns 0. Once the LF or CR has been detected, the function
returns the number of characters in the string.  

The code as written has been tested for 8 RC channels.
